This ANPR system is used to identify, track, count, and read license plate present in an image or video after its video has been processed and saved from a camera, preferrably a highway speed camera that also has
optical zoom.

The Machine Learning Model used in this project is from Ultralytics' YOLO (You Only Look Once). A CNN Model that is known for its great performance and versatile applications. The version that I used was the Yolo V11

This project is to demonstrate how Python a general-purpose programming language can leverage the use of Machine Learning Models along with integrating Computer Vision and OCR techniques. The front end technology 
used is Streamlit, which is an easy-to-use Python package that can be used to make a wide variety of websites. From Portfolio's to Demo Websites to Data Sites and so on.

I hope you enjoy and learn a lot in this project of mine. This project can be used to develop a real ANPR system that gets videos from a Highway CCTV speed cam that identifies, counts, and reads license plates from v
vehicles passing by on the expressway.

This project also showcases my skill and capability to create a project that is Machine Learning related, documented in Git, and fully deployed as well even for Demo purposes only.
